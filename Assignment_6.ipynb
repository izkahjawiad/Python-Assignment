    "2. Modularity: each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other \n",
    "    parts of the system. \n",
    "3. Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an \n",
    "    OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public \n",
    "    interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods. \n",

    "Method: A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated \n",
    "    with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created \n",
    "    from the class. Another way to say this is that a method is an action that an \n",
    "    object is able to perform. The association between method and class is called \n",
    "    binding. Consider the example of an object of the type 'person,' created using \n",
    "    the person class. Methods associated with this class could consist of things like \n",
    "    walking and driving. Methods are sometimes confused with functions, but they are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: A function is a combination of instructions that are combined to \n",
    "    achieve some result. A function typically requires some input (called arguments) \n",
    "    and returns some results. For example, consider the example of driving a car. To \n",
    "    determine the mileage, you need to perform a calculation using the distance driven \n",
    "    and the amount of fuel used. You could write a function to do this calculation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Difference: Method and a function are the same, with different terms. A method is a \n",
    "    procedure or function in object-oriented programming. A function is a group of \n",
    "    reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the \n",
    "    need for writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes."
